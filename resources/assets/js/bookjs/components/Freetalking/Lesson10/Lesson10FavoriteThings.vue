They are not mere collections of pictures but diaries as well. My parents made them together.  They pasted our pictures and wrote down the experiences and ideas in words. They also pasted leaves and flowers that we got during our several excursions. They are very precious to me because my parents died when I was a teenager and these albums helped me not to feel that I was alone.</p>
